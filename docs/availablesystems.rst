Virtualised Systems
===================

We have a number of virtualised platforms for running general purpose workloads.  For more information, please contact us.

CFMS hosts a 'technology lab' where we can host hardware or software for short or long periods.   This is particularly useful for developing
proof-of-concept implementations, or determining how a technology will integrate with a current workflow.
