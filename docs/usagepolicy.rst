Data Storage Policy
===================
Data Availability
-----------------
All data uploaded or generated on the HPC cluster remains the responsibility of the user.   Although CFMS implement technologies to help ensure the availability of the data, the parallel filesystem is not backed up offsite, and in case of catastrophic failure, this data could be lost.

Data Encryption
---------------
Due to the significant performance impact imposed by encryption, our parallel filesystem is not encrypted.   If your company policy requires that data should be encrypted at rest, you will need to investigate if this can be supported by your application.

Data collection and data protection policy
------------------------------------------
The Data Protection Act 1988 (DPA) creates rights and responsibilities around how we handle the personal data we collect.
We are committed to ensuring that we comply with the eight data protection principles:

+ First principle - Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully.
+ Second principle - Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.
+ Third principle - Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.
+ Fourth principle - Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
+ Fifth principle - Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
+ Sixth principle - Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under this Act.
+ Seventh principle - Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.
+ Eighth principle - Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area, unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.
