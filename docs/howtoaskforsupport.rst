How to Ask For Support
======================

The CFMS support team are responsible for a large number of systems within the
CFMS environment, so it might not be immediately obvious if you have a question
or a problem to which system you are referring.

If you need to raise a support ticket, please endeavour to include as much information
as possible:

- What system are you working with
- What application are you using
- Do you see any errors?   If so, please include logfiles or screenshots as appropriate
- (HPC) - what interactive node are you working on
- (HPC) - what are your job numbers
- (HPC) - what nodes are affected
