Remote Access
=============

Remote access to our systems is either via SSL VPN, or alternatively some user groups have
dedicated SSH connection via their corporate network.   If you are unsure what method you should
be using to access the systems here, please contact support@cfms.org.uk

VPN
---

The VPN is provided by 'Pulse Secure' (previously Juniper Pulse/Network Connect).
There are native 'Pulse Secure' clients for Windows and macOS, or 'openconnect' on Linux.

The VPN service makes use of "two-factor" authentication via Google Authenticator, to provide an additional layer of security by requiring a code generated by a mobile app to be used as well as username/password.
This service does not require signing up for a Google account, but just requires the installation of the "Google Authenticator" app, available on iOS and Android.
If you do not have access to a smartphone, or are unable to install Google Authenticator, please contact us.

Before First Connection

follow the instructions to install Google Authenticator and configure it to your account.
